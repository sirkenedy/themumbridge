The Mum Bridge – Concept Note
Vision
A world where every mother with disability has equal access, opportunity, and support to thrive in motherhood and society.
Mission
We exist to build an inclusive global community where mothers with disabilities can:
Connect with one another through peer support networks and accessible community spaces.
Access practical resources for parenting, health, financial independence, and everyday life.
Share lived experiences to shift harmful narratives and increase visibility of mothers with disabilities. 
Build emotional resilience and social connection that reduces isolation and improves wellbeing.
Advocate for inclusion in healthcare, parenting systems, workplaces, and social protection.
The Problem
Globally, around 20% of women live with a disability, according to the World Bank’s Disability Data Hub. In Nigeria, about 6.9% of adults aged 15 and older live with some functional difficulty, equivalent to roughly 7–8 million adults, and the rate is higher for women at 7.5% (Disability Data Initiative). Other national estimates suggest that approximately 29 million Nigerians across all age groups live with a disability (World Bank/WHO, 2018).
Mothers with disabilities face barriers at every turn: inaccessible healthcare facilities, social isolation from stigma, and economic exclusion from inflexible work environments. Parenting systems rarely include accessibility. Maternal healthcare can be difficult to reach or completely unavailable. Stigma and misconceptions isolate mothers from support networks. Mothers with disabilities may face examination tables they cannot access, prenatal classes without sign language interpreters, or playgrounds their children attend but they cannot enter. Without tailored support, these mothers and their children face elevated risks that affect their health, education, and economic wellbeing.
Our Theory of Change
The Mum Bridge strengthens the wellbeing of mothers with disabilities by building connections, increasing access to support, and creating pathways to economic participation.

Core Values
“We see mothers not through their limitations, but through their strength.”
Inclusion: Every mother with disability belongs, no matter her background, story, or ability.
Empathy: Support rooted in understanding and shared humanity.
Lived Experience Leadership: Guidance shaped by lived experience, not assumptions.
Empowerment: Helping mothers find their voice, confidence, and independence.
Storytelling: Sharing real stories to connect hearts and inspire change.
Target Audience
Primary: Mothers with disabilities in Nigeria during the pilot phase.
Secondary: Mothers with disabilities across Africa and worldwide, reached through accessible digital platforms and partnerships.
Why Nigeria First
Nigeria provides a high-impact starting point for The Mum Bridge due to its large population, clear disability inclusion gaps, and rapidly growing digital connectivity.
Significant disability population: Approximately 6.9% of adults aged 15 and older in Nigeria live with functional difficulties, equivalent to roughly 7–8 million adults, and the rate is higher among women at 7.5% (Disability Data Initiative).
High overall estimates: Other credible sources suggest that around 29 million Nigerians live with disabilities, highlighting a major inclusion gap.
Digital adoption enables access: Nigeria has an estimated 36+ million social media users and over 51 million active WhatsApp users, creating a strong infrastructure for community-driven support.
Growing disability advocacy: Increasing visibility of disability rights movements provides momentum for a model centered on lived experience.
Scalable environment: Success in Nigeria can inform expansion across Africa and other regions with similar socio-economic and cultural dynamics.
Launching in Nigeria allows us to demonstrate what is possible when mothers with disabilities are connected, supported, and seen and set the foundation for a scalable global movement.
